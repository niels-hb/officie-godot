# Officie
## Ideas
- Buy staff for currency, limited time, monthly salary
- Downtime between customers -> Shorten time via currency
- Unlocks based on level
- Upgrade rooms/furniture
- Monthly electricy & water bills based on office size
- Monthly revenue statement
- Events to boost income for set amount of time
- Food/drinks bar/restaurant boost income on that floor
- Player can own multiple buildings/floors
- "Supermarket" system where people have to stock supplies -> Escalate to F&B manager, who will stock up automatically but costs currency each month
- Cleaning as manual action, later the player has the option to hire cleaning staff but costs currency each month
- Manually collect money from customers in the beginning, automate later (e.g. hire an accountant)
- Moving/removing rooms costs currency
